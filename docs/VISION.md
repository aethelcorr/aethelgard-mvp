# Aethelgard — Vision

Aethelgard is a Temporal Context Engine.
It eliminates human and machine context-switch latency by preloading
the exact information, resources, and intelligence required before
a task is initiated.

The product is not a task manager.
It is not a chatbot.
It is not a dashboard.

It is an anticipatory system that treats time as a programmable variable.

Success is defined by:
- Reduced decision latency
- Reduced coordination overhead
- Increased organizational coherence

Failure is defined by:
- Reactive behavior
- Manual context retrieval
- Human-initiated synchronization
